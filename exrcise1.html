            <p style="color: orange;">
                SEO stands for search engine optimization, which is a set of practices designed to improve the appearance and positioning of web pages in organic search results. Because organic search is the most prominent way for people to discover and access online content,
                 a good SEO strategy is essential for improving the quality and quantity of traffic to your website.

                <strong>search results:</strong> the unpaid listings on a search engine results page (SERP) that the search engine has determined are most relevant to the user’s query. Ads (in this context, PPC or pay-per-click ads) make up a significant portion of many SERPs. Organic search results are distinct from these ads in that they are positioned based on the search engine’s organic ranking algorithms rather than advertiser bids. 
                You can’t pay for your page to rank higher in organic search results.

                Quality of organic traffic: how relevant the user and their search query are to the content that exists on your website. You can attract all the visitors in the world, but if they're coming to your site because Google tells them you're a resource for Apple computers when really you're a farmer selling apples, those visitors are likely to leave your site without completing any conversions. High-quality traffic includes only visitors
                 who are genuinely interested in the products, information, or other resources your site offers.
